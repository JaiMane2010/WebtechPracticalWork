            <p>Decades of expeditions. Thousands of kilometers of traversing the most challenging terrain. Years of living and evolving with a machine that responds to the mountains. That's how we made the Himalayan, our first dual-purpose motorcycle.
                The half-duplex split cradle frame and long travel suspension keep you in harmony with road, rocks, and everything in between.
                800mm seat height, perfectly positioned footpegs and handlebars reduce fatigue and give you a comfortable upright riding position whether you sit or stand.
                Go anywhere your adventure takes you. The Tripperâ„¢ navigation system on your Himalayan keeps you on course. Its powered by Google Maps and the Royal Enfield app, keeping your smartphone connected to your Himalayan through Bluetooth. The intuitive display system guides you through the road, notifying you before every turn.
